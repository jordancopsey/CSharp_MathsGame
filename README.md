The requirements are as follows:
Create a Math game containing the 4 basic operations
The divisions should result on INTEGERS ONLY and dividends should go from 0 to 100. The app shouldn't present the division 7/2 to the user, since it doesn't result in an integer etc.
Users should be presented with a menu to choose an operation
Record previous games in a List and there should be an option in the menu for the user to visualize a history of previous games.
